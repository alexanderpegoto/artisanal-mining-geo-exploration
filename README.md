# Geospatial Analysis of Artisanal Mining Sites in Eastern Congo

## Case Study Overview
This project explores geospatial data focused on artisanal mining sites in Eastern Congo, using an open dataset provided by the International Peace Information Service (IPIS). It serves as a comprehensive application of geospatial techniques in Python—bringing together everything learned in previous modules, while introducing new spatial analysis tools along the way.

## Data

The dataset originates from IPIS, an organization dedicated to providing objective information on areas affected by conflict. It includes detailed records of:
	•	Mining site locations
	•	Types of minerals extracted
	•	Security and social conditions surrounding each site

## Project Goals
	•	Perform spatial analysis of artisanal mining locations in Eastern Congo
	•	Examine the proximity of mining sites to national parks
	•	Understand how geospatial data can support broader questions about resource exploitation and regional conflict

While this project focuses on the spatial dimension, the original dataset also includes rich social and security information. For further exploration, visit the IPIS open data tutorial.

## Technologies Used
	•	Python (Geopandas, Shapely, Folium, etc.)
	•	Jupyter Notebooks
	•	Open Geospatial Data
